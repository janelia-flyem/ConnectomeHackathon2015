Information for the Janelia Connectome Workshop and Hackathon 2015.  The repository contains files that will be useful for hackathon attendees.  See the [Hackathon Wiki](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/ConnectomeHackathon2015/wiki) for more information including documentation and use cases.

The package includes (see the wiki for more detailed descriptions):
* A directory of skeletons corresponding to the largest neurons in our dataset.  Each file is named by a unique body ID.
* A synapse file that shows how these bodies are connected and the location of the synapese.
* A body description file that provides information about several important body IDs (what is it name, cell type, and other useful information)
